Make sure a `.npmrc` file is present in your repo, which should contain something like: `@faithlife:registry=http://npm.faithlife.io`\n1. Run `yarn add @faithlife/styled-ui styled-components`.  **Make sure to add styled-ui as a peer dependency to your project if you are hosting it within Faithlife.com (see below)**.\n1. Ship it!\n\n## Guidelines for use\nUse the className prop to control margins, font appearance, etc on an imported component. Prefer not to add style hacks that override the contents of the component (such as a style that uses a pseudo selector to display additional content), since the underlying styles could change in a future version update. If you need this level of customization, copy the component and styles into your own project and continue on from there.\n\nIf you're using the included Bootstrap components, you can use the [spacing utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/spacing/) in the className prop.\n\n## There are some components in Experimental, should I use those?\n\nWe're working on consolidating the Bootstrap components and the components in the Experimental folder. These components are very light-weight and will ultimately replace any Bootstrap components that already exist in this library. You can use them now but some of the props might change in a future update (we'll coordinate with consumers when making breaking changes)\n\n## How to contribute\n\n1. Follow the directions on the [Github repo](https://github.com/faithlife/styled-ui)\n\n## Why are peer dependencies necessary for hosted components?\n\nSome third party components within styled-ui depend on a global stylesheet to be loaded on the page. Because these styles are not scoped, we need to ensure the components and the loaded global styles on the page stay in sync. Without using peer dependencies, styled-ui components might reference styles on the page that have not been loaded properly.\n\n`styled-components` also requires that only one instance is running within an app. See the [FAQs](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/faqs) for more information\n"}});
